This project is a microservices-based To-Do List Application developed using Java Spring Boot. It allows users to manage their tasks efficiently through a set of RESTful APIs.

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Spring Boot
- Postman (for API testing)

## Features
- Add, edit, and delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- User-friendly interface

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in your IDE
3. Run each microservice separately
4. Use Postman to access the APIs
5. Access the application using the base URL provided by each microservice

## Microservices
- **Task Service**: Manages tasks
- **User Service**: Manages users
- **Authentication Service**: Provides authentication for users

## Endpoints
- **GET /tasks**: Get all tasks
- **POST /tasks**: Add a new task
- **GET /users**: Get all users
- **POST /users**: Add a new user

## How to Test
1. Import the provided Postman collection
2. Update the base URL for each request to match your local setup
3. Use the provided endpoints to test the functionality
